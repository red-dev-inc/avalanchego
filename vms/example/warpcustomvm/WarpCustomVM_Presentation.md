## 🤔 The Problem - Isolated Islands

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); color: white; padding: 10px 20px; border-radius: 20px;">

### **Imagine This Scenario:**

```
🏝️ Island A              🏝️ Island B              🏝️ Island C
(Your Bank)            (Shopping Mall)          (Government)

   💰                        🛍️                       📄
  
They can't communicate with each other!
```

### **Today's Blockchain Problem:**

- **Different blockchains** = Different islands
- **Each blockchain** operates independently
- **No easy way** to share information between them
- **Users must manually** bridge between chains

**Result:** Inefficient, slow, and complicated! 😓
